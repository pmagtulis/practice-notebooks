# practice-notebooks
Compilation of my coding practice notebooks tackling different stuff from simple Python to scraping and pandas.

# What's in it?

Each **directory** contains notebooks and source files used for my practice coding using Jupyter Notebook.

Topics covered on each:

|Directory|Topics|
|---|---|
|API|Going through website's API and getting select information. We use Pokemon API and Weather API for this one|
|Camelot|Parsed through the Philippine Department of Health's annual health statistics report and select few tables to **transform and process into data frame.**|
|pandas|A number of notebooks all about pandas (i.e. reading through files, using datetimes, cleaning and plotting data, etc.)|
|scraping|Selenium practice notebooks|
